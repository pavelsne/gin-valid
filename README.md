# gin-valid

gin-valid is the G-Node Infrastructure data validation service. It is a microservice server written in go that is meant to be run together with a GIN repository server.

Repositories on a GIN server can trigger validation of data files via this service. Currently there are two validators supported:
- The [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io) fMRI data format.
- The [NIX](http://g-node.org/nix) (Neuroscience Information Exchange) format.
